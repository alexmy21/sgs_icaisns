    "# Self-Generative Systems (SGS) with an integrated Large Language Model (LLM). \n",
    "\n",
    "This presentation outlines an efficient and unobtrusive method for integrating AI models, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), into the SGS framework in a plug-and-play manner. A central aspect of this integration is the shared tokenization process, which supplies input to both the Metadata Models (MM) and the LLMs. This shared input guarantees that both components process the same foundational data, thereby enhancing system performance through improved efficiency and coherence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution focuses on enhancing the tokenizer of the specific LLM, which in our case is the GPT2Tokenizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the ExtendedGPT2Tokenizer, two key methods are responsible for these tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `tokenize_text(text)`: This method tokenizes the input text.\n",
    "- `update_tensors(token_ids)`: This method updates the tensors, which hold Meta Model HllSets data, based on the token IDs.\n"
